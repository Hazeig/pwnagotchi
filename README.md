# Pwnagotchi

Pwnagotchi is an "AI" that learns from the WiFi environment and instruments bettercap in order to maximize the number of WPA handshakes captured. Specifically, it's using an [LSTM with MLP feature extractor](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/policies.html#stable_baselines.common.policies.MlpLstmPolicy) as its policy network for the [A2C agent](https://stable-baselines.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/a2c.html)
